Space Reactor Computational Modeling
====================================

This repository contains optimization scripts for the design of a direct-cooled
sCO2 nuclear reactor for space applications. The scripts are used as surrogate
models of the reactor in an overall system mass calculation. These models will
be used in conjunction with a power cycle model to minimize overall system mass.
